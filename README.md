The code of Task 1 now runs task1_metrics to generate a csv, and then runs add_flip_metrics. This code adds some metrics to task1_metrics and also generates a csv at the end. Finally, it runs figs, which is based on the final generated csv to produce the graph. All these codes are running in the terminal. I noted at the beginning how to run them. Just paste and copy them directly into the terminal to run. The code operation requires the csv files generated by the senior code: task1_fan_vote_estimates and task1_week_summary

Task2 is divided into Task 2_1 and Task2_2, which are the first, second and third sub-questions of the problem. The third sub-question is a textual description without code.

Task 2_1 first runs generate_csv to generate two CSVS. make_task2_1_figs and make_task2_1_extra_box_violin are both the codes for generating images, without any particular order. make_task2_1_extra_box_violin added two graphs to further verify with other metrics that rank is more inclined towards fans. The code operation requires the csv generated by the senior's code: task1_fan_vote_estimates, task2_rule_comparison_deterministic and task2_rule_comparison_probabilistic

There is only one code task2_2_ensemble_union in Task2_2, and the required csv files are: 2026_MCM_Problem_C_Data and task1_fan_vote_estimates
